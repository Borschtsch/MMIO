MMIO++ is an embedded Memory Mapped I/O registers access framework developed in C++ which allows to develop expressive code with respect to type safety, runtime or compile time flexibility and performance.
It is mainly targeted for MCUs with integrated hardware but can also be used to describe registers of the hardware that can be accessed using SPI, I2C, etc.
